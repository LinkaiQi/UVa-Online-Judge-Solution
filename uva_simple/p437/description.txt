# /* UVa problem: 437
#  *
#  * Topic: Graph Traversal
#  *
#  * Level: easy
#  *
#  * Brief problem description:
#  *   Given n types of blocks, and an unlimited supply of blocks of each type.
#  *   Each type blick was a rectangular solid with linear dimensions (x, y, z).
#  *   A block could be reoriented so that any dimension can be the height.
#  *   One blick could only be placed on top of another block as long as the two
#  *   base dimension of the upper block were both strictly smaller than the corresponding
#  *   base dimension of the lower block.
#  *   The problem asks the maximum height of tower that can be built using blocks available.
#  *
#  * Solution Summary:
#  *   This problem can be solved by constructing a DAG graph, each block orientation
#  *   is a node. An edge exists from a block to another if it can be built over
#  *   the other.
#  *   Find the longest path(weight) in the DAG.
#  *
#  * Used Resources:
#  *   None
#  *
#  * I hereby certify that I have produced the following solution myself
#  * using only the resources listed above in accordance with the CMPUT
#  * 403 collaboration policy.
