/* UVa problem: 10026
 *
 * Topic: Sorting
 *
 * Level: easy
 *
 * Brief problem description:
 *   "We are to help an overburdened shoemaker who must pay a fee for everyday
 *   that he has not finished a job. He has N <= 1000 jobs, the ith job takes
 *   a time T_{i} to complete and has daily unfinished cost of S_{i}.
 *   We must help the shoemaker minimize the amount of fines that he must pay
 *   by finding the optimal order in which to make the shoes." --- algorithmist
 *
 * Solution Summary:
 *   This problem can be solved by using greedy method. Do the job that has
 *   highest fine/time ratio first is the optimal solution.
 *   Proof:
 *      Suppose the optionl solution is OPT = .. + S_{i} * (.. + T_{i-1}) +
 *        S_{i+1} * (.. + T_{i-1} + T_{i}) + ...
 *      If we switch the order of job_i and  job_i+1, the cost will be:
 *        C = .. + S_{i+1} * (.. + T_{i-1}) + S_{i} * (.. + T_{i-1} + T_{i+1}) + ...
 *      Since OPT is the optional solution, OPT <= Cï¼Œ S_{i+1}*T_{i } <= S_{i}*T_{i+1}
 *      Therefore S_{i+1} / T_{i+1} <= S_{i} / T_{i}
