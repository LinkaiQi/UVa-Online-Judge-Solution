/* UVa problem: 11195
 *
 * Topic: Backtracking
 *
 * Level: challenging
 *
 * Brief problem description:
 *   N-QUEEN problem:
 *   Count the number of placement of n queens on an n * n board so that no
 *   two queens attack each other.
 *   There are some bad squares where queens cannot be placed. (ad squares
 *   cannot be used to block queensâ€™ attack)
 *
 * Solution Summary:
 *   This problem can be solved by using backtracking. We try to place queens
 *   one by one in different columns. When we place a queen, we check whether
 *   the queen is conflict with other queens. If we have found a way to place
 *   the queens then we backtrack and return 1.
 *
 * Used Resources:
 *   -
 *
 * I hereby certify that I have produced the following solution myself
 * using only the resources listed above in accordance with the CMPUT
 * 403 collaboration policy.
