/* UVa problem: 356
 *
 * Topic: Geometry
 *
 * Level: challenging
 *
 * Brief problem description:
 *   "A circle 2n âˆ’ 1 units in diameter has been drawn centered on a 2n by 2n chessboard.
 *   Write a program that will determine the number of cells of the board which
 *   contain a segment of the circle and the number of cells of the board which
 *   lie entirely inside the circle." -- UVa_online_Judge
 *
 * Solution Summary:
 *   Since a circle is symmetric in both up-bottom and left-right direction, we
 *   only need to consider the 1/4 of the circle, (e.g top-right corner).
 *   Each cell in the chessboard is a square which has upper right and lower left
 *   vertice. If only the lower left vertix (x, y) of the cell is inside the circle
 *   (x^2 + y^2 < r^2), we can say that the cell contain a segment of the circle.
 *   If both lower left vertix (x, y), and upper right vertix (x+1, y+1) of the
 *   cell is inside the circle, the cell lie entirely inside the circle.
 *
 * Used Resources:
 *   None

 * I hereby certify that I have produced the following solution myself
 * using only the resources listed above in accordance with the CMPUT
