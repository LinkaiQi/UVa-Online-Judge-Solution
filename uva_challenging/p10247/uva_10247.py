# /* UVa problem: 10247
#  *
#  * Topic: Combinatorics
#  *
#  * Level: challenging
#  *
#  * Brief problem description:
#  *    Given the depth and branching factor of such a tree, determine in how
#  *    many different ways you can number the nodes of the tree so that the
#  *    label of each node is less that that of its descendants.
#  *    Assume that for numbering a tree with N nodes we have the (1, 2, 3,
#  *    N âˆ’ 1, N ) labels available.
#  *
#  * Solution Summary:
#  *    "Let f(k, d) denote the number of labelings of the k-ary tree of depth d.
#  *    Moreover, let n(k, d) denote the number of nodes of the tree.
#  *    The tree contains k subtrees, each contains n(k, d-1) nodes.
#  *    There are totally  (n(k, d)-1)! / (n(k, d-1)!)^k ways to partition
#  *    the n(k, d)-1 labels into k different subsets, each have the same size
#  *     of n(k, d-1), therefore we can draw this recurrence:
#  *       f(k, d) = (n(k, d) - 1)! / (n(k, d-1)!)^k * f(k, d-1)^k
#  *    with base cases of
#  *       f(k, 0) = 1 " -- CSDN liukaipeng "https://blog.csdn.net/liukaipeng"
